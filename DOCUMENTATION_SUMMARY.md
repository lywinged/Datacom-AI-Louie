## Design Decisions Summary

### 1. FastAPI (vs Flask/Django)
- ✅ 2-3x throughput (async I/O)
- ✅ Auto-generated API docs
- ⚠️ Steeper learning curve

### 2. ONNX Quantization (vs PyTorch)
- ✅ 5-10x faster inference
- ✅ 75% smaller models
- ⚠️ ~1-2% accuracy loss

### 3. Qdrant (vs Pinecone/Weaviate)
- ✅ 50ms search latency
- ✅ Self-hosted (cost savings)
- ⚠️ Infrastructure management

### 4. Dual-Mode Models
- ✅ Flexibility (quality vs speed)
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ⚠️ Added complexity

### 5. 95% Test Coverage
- ✅ CI/CD ready (0.54s execution)
- ✅ Catches regressions early
- ⚠️ Upfront time investment

### 6. Docker Compose
- ✅ Service isolation
- ✅ Dev/prod parity
- ⚠️ Networking complexity
